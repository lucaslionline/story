這是一首讓我想起Jimmy的歌。總有一些人，讓我不忍打擾、不捨忘記。

Don’t you ever question why I’m by your side /
I’m here when you cry cos he told you lies so slyly /
I run my fingers through your hair and show I care /
But I’m not the one that your heart belongs to nightly

But if I stay would you kiss me in the summer rain /
Or let me wash away into the sand /
Would we lie together underneath the burning sun /
And let our two hearts beat as one

If I stay would you let me hold you in my arms /
And later take a walk beneath the stars /
Woah, tell me someday these could all be real /
And end this heartache I’m pained to feel

I’ve loved you without regret since the day we met /
If what you see’s what you get /
Well I’ve had nothing yet for these past years /
Tell me will you ever feel the same if my love won’t tame /
Or just like cellophane /
Will I call your name unto deaf ears

And if I stay would you kiss me in the summer rain /
Or let me wash away into the sand /
Would we lie together underneath the burning sun /
And let our two hearts beat as one

If I stay would you let me hold you in my arms /
And later take a walk beneath the stars /
Woah, tell me someday these could all be real /
And end this heartache I’m pained to feel
